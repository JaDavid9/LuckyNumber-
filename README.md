The LuckyGame consists of three levels. On the first level, the player has 10 attempts to guess a number between 1 and 50. On the second level, the player has 8 attempts to guess a number between 1 and 100. Finally, on the third level, the player has 5 attempts to guess a number between 1 and 200.

When the player enters a number, they receive feedback: if they guess correctly, they get a message that they passed the level. If they don't guess correctly, they receive a message indicating whether the target number is smaller or larger than the entered number.

After installation, the project is started by opening the command prompt and following these steps:

cd LuckyNumber
code . // (opens VS Code)
python LuckyNumber.py
